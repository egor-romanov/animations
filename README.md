# animations

Just my personal project to create some beautiful animations with [motion-canvas](https://motioncanvas.io).

## Why?

Sometime I need nice code animations for posts or talks. I found motion canvas as a great tool to do this, 
cause I am bad in animation software, but with motion canvas I can create smooth gifs easily with few lines of code.

Just fork a project on replit: https://replit.com/@egor-romanov/animations

## png to gif

Motion-canvas renders your animations as a bunch of `png` images, while sometimes you may want it to be a `gif`.

Check out [this repo](https://github.com/egor-romanov/png2gif) if you prefer using terminal tools for such things. 
You will find a simple CLI app there that turns a sequence of images into `gif`.
